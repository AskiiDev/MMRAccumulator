# MMR Accumulator (In Progress)

C implementation of a Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) accumulator with efficient element addition, removal, and membership verification.

## Overview

This library provides a cryptographic accumulator based on Merkle Mountain Ranges:
- Add elements and maintain a compact representation of a set
- Generate inclusion proofs (witnesses) for elements (planned feature)
- Verify membership of elements using witnesses
- Remove elements with appropriate witnesses (planned feature)
